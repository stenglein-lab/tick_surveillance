### Conda environment to run this pipeline

The yaml files in this directory contains the definition of conda environments that can be used to run this pipeline when using conda to handle software dependencies.  However, it is recommended to use singularity to satisfy dependencies instead.  

For more information on software dependency handling, see [this pipeline instructions document](../Pipeline_instructions.md#Dependencies).
